               what we do. All our teachers have a depth of experience that they bring to each class and workshop. We do not have a 
               one-size-fits-all approach, you will be seen, heard, and valued in our warm and welcoming environment. We are a relaxing 
               sanctuary amidst the hustle and bustle of downtown Edmonton, and your busy lives. It is our hope that you will find:

            <h2>Studio Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>
              The homey atmosphere creates a soothing environment which sets you at ease at once. We are a smaller one room studio, which means
              smaller class sizes and more hands-on instruction, with personal interaction.

            <h2>Studio Etiquette</h2>
            <p>
              The yoga room is silent before, during and after class. During the class, the instructor is the only one speaking. There are some
              general etiquette guidelines to follow in the studio: 
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>With respect to those sensitive to fragrances we ask that you refrain from wearing strong scents. We also refrain from burning incense.</li>
              <li>We ask you to be mindful of others at the studio if you plan on attending class please be on time to respect the sacred place of others.</li>
              <li>The instruction is verbal and very technical with no demonstrations. It is very important that you are actively listening to the instructor throughout class and allow others the same courtesy.</li>
              <li>There are no shoes in the studio. Please be aware that you’ll be barefoot in the yoga room - any contagious foot conditions should be treated as soon as possible or covered/dressed while walking through the studio.</li>
              <li>Please bring only your mat, towel, and water into the room. Do not bring purses, wallets, phones or other distractions. Due to the heat and humidity in the room, these types of items could be damaged and may pose as a distraction.</li>
            </ol>

              With so many different options, which is the best class for me?

              self-awareness through movement, postures and breath.

            <h2>Something Active</h2>
            <p>
              The flow classes continuously move your body integrating strength and flexibility in a non-stop shift from posture to posture. The flow classes
              vary from slower basic movements to progressively more advanced. We support slower movements and believe in the healing aspects associated with
              the ability to slow down and stay present. Our teachers encourage a mindful state to practice from, which supports healing physically, emotionally,
              and spiritually.

            <h2>Spring Yin Workshop</h2>
            <p>
              It happens every spring. This year’s Spring Yin Workshop will be with Tori Lunden on Saturday, May 13, 2023 from 2:15pm - 4:15pm.
            </p>

            <p>
              After the joy and jubilation of being able to play outside comes the aches and pains in areas we forgot we had. It comes as a bit of a shock
              to our bodies this shift to suddenly gardening, biking, running, hiking, along with all the other outdoor activities we love. Even for those
              that stay active through the winter; the spring is often accompanied by stiff muscles and creaky joints.
            </p>

            <p>
              This extended practice will help our bodies through this rocky transition with a combination of gentle movement and passive, supported stretches
              for the shoulders, back, and hips. Take two hours to relax and restore so you can get on with enjoying our beautiful Edmonton summer.
            </p>

            <p>
              This practice is suitable for beginners, experienced students, and especially beneficial for those with active lifestyles.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>The cost will be $30 (includes GST).</li>

            </ul>
        
            <p>
              Tori's classes are always a fun and eclectic environment. She delights in teaching people who, like her, never thought yoga was something they
              could do let alone enjoy. Tori has a degree in social work from the University of Calgary and has been teaching yoga since 2008; when she would
              never again work anywhere that required her to sit for eight hours a day.

            <h2>Clothes Swap</h2>
            <p>
               We are having a Clothing Swap at the studio on Saturday, April 15, 2023, from 2:15pm - 4:15pm. Bring us your worn but still awesome cloths and
              in exchange take home a new spring wardrobe! This of course extends to shoes, jewelry, books... (then stay and check out the new class).
            </p>

            <p>
              The clothing swaps are a great community event! Come and chat with those faces you see in classes, but maybe have never talked to. If it is a nice
              day we can hang out on the roof and have tea! If you do not have anything to exchange, come and sift through the piles and take home some treasures.
              If you cannot stay, feel free to drop things off.
            </p>

            <p>
              Everything left over will get donated!
